# GhostHousePong
Ghost House Pong is a small-scale Unity tennis game I developed in early 2022 as part of a Game Jam. Its main game mode is flexible with numerous customization options, local multiplayer with controller support, and a rudimentary AI to play against.

HOW TO PLAY
===========
No installation required! Simply run the executable contained within the folder downloaded from the Main Page on itch.io. Upon reaching the title screen, press ENTER on your keyboard or START on your USB controller to begin your game.

Configure the various settings to your liking using the keys or buttons displayed on the screen, which will change depending on whether or not a controller is connected. Whenever you're ready, navigate to "Go!" and press the Fire button ("G" on your Keyboard or the A button on your controller) to get started!

**Note:** When playing doubles, players 3 and 4 must use controllers.

STRATEGY
===========

_**Angle Your Shots.**_ When the ball hits your paddle, the direction it bounces away is dependent on your position. To straighten your shot, try catching the ball in the center of your paddle. Alternatively, to fire at a steep angle, try to catch the ball on the edge of your paddle.

_**Swing for Power Shots.**_ By pressing and releasing the Fire button on your controller or keyboard, you'll perform a **Swing**. If you manage to catch the ball at the apex of a swing, it will launch away at incredible speed. This is known as a **Power Shot**, and it is essential to defeating skilled players.

_**Curve your Swings.**_ While charging a swing, your movement is slowed. If you release a swing while moving, you'll perform a **Dive**, launching yourself in the direction of your movement. A Power Shot performed during a dive will curve away in the direction of the dive, possibly sneaking through a player's defenses.

_**Mind Your Court.**_ All seven of this game's courts are unique. Six of them feature environmental hazards that can change the way you and your opponent play the game. For example, the Stormy Court features a wind tunnel that will push the ball up or down as it moves across. Use these to your advantage!
